title: Quorum Systems 
---

During the course of my continuing struggle with PBFT, which deserves its own blog entry, I caught a reference
to a term *dissemination quorum*. Previously content with the explanation of quorum being a fanciful term for
describing a subset of nodes, of which the most common type is majority quorum, I followed the references
rather reluctantly. And was deservedly served a big humble pie.

The idea of quorums and quorum system dates as far back as the time when computer failures were recognized as
a real problem. It exists before FLP, before Paxos, and by extension, long before PBFT. The reason why it
rarely surfaces can be attributed to its theoretical nature. And similar to FLP, its popularity was eclipsed
by the popularity of later work that take the theoretical results and make them more practical. Studies of
quorum systems pave the way for Paxos, PBFT and many other work in making distributed systems tolerant to
failures. Quorum systems for crash failure are different to and simpler than for Byzantine failures. I will
focus on the latter. 

## What is a quorum?

Given a set of node $$U$$, a quorum system is a set of subsets of $$U$$ (or quorums) in which **any two quorums
intersect**. More formally, $$Q$$ is a quorum system defined as $$Q \subseteq \mathbb{P}(U) \ \wedge \ \forall q_1, q_2
\in Q [ q_1 \ \cap \ q2 \neq \emptyset ]$$ 

Why interesting? In the context of replicated systems. 


## Examples

A set of majority subsets in $$U$$ is a quorum system. In fact, it is the most common instance of quorum systems,
found most often in fault-tolerant protocols. Paxos, in particular, relies on quorums of size $$f+1$$ in network of
$$2f+1$$ nodes. However, there are other examples whose quorums are not majority set.

The figure above illustrates two quorum systems derived from $$U$$ of 16 nodes. The first system, called majority
quorum, is made up of majority-set quorums wherein each quorum is of size 9. The second, called grid quorum, consists of
quorums of size 7, but each pair always intersects at least 2 nodes. There are $$|U|$$ quorums in this example, where
$$q_{ij}$$ comprises node in row $$i$$ and column $$j$$.
