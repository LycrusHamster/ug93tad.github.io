He was old, a typical Midetarienance old man with a rather big belly, a cherry face. He had a white shirt on, a ragged
cap and a poorly laminated map of the city.

"Hello there, where do want to go". His voice is hoarse, starting me a little. 

"Western Wall please"

"Come here..."

With trembling fingers, he pointed me the direction to the Old City's famous Western Wall on the rumpled map.  

"Where are you from?" He started the small talk, feigining interest, before I had a chance to say thanks. 

[... my answering this and another followed-up question ...]

"Now, young man. Please give me 5 shekel"

Ohh.. shit..

There went a hightlight of my journey to Jerusalem's Old City. The city was and still is the center of the world's
religions. Or at least the center of Judaism -- considered the predecessor of most of the modern's religions. Even
discounting the fact that it was built thousands of years ago (most of its famous sites are much older than 2000 years
old), the city is a modern day's marvel of architecture.

Enclosed by high walls and accessible via only a few gates, it is a city built from stones. Seen from afar, the stony
wall, serveral church spires culminating on the dome of the Temple Mount, exude an air of fairy tale, of kings and
prophets, and of holiness. The city's main roads and its narrow valley are paved in stones, the houses are sturdy blocks
of stone. The winds blow fiercely in the cramped and steept paths, sunlights skewered through the canopy under which
lies street mechandise in vast number and in blinding colors.
